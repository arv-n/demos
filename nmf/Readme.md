To use the presentation notebook interactively, you will need to have the Julia package [Pluto.jl](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) installed. Along with the following dependencies:
- LinearAlgebra
- NMF.jl
- Plots.jl
- DataFrames.jl
- CSV.jl

The interactive content depends on 'mnist_test.csv'. Please extract mnist.zip within the same folder before running nmf.jl

Static (non-interactive) versions as PDF,  can be found under the same filename.
