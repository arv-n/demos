## SIAM TU Delft baNaNa Talk, Jan 2021 on *Pluto.jl*
This talk on *Pluto.jl* was given when it was still the new kid on the block. The popularity of this impressive tool has exponentially increased since then.

Nonetheless, here's some resources that got me started: 
- start here: [GitHub](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl/)
- [Official Readme](https://juliahub.com/docs/Pluto/OJqMt/0.7.4/)
- [MIT Course on Computational Thinking with Julia](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/Fall20/)
- [Binder](https://hub.gke2.mybinder.org/user/fonsp-pluto-on-binder-tt7zur5m/pluto/sample) (for the skeptics!)

Project [Project baNaNa](http://projectbanana.github.io/) is a self-organised seminar from the PhD students of the numerical analysis department at TU Delft. Check them out, plentiful resources for the budding researcher!
